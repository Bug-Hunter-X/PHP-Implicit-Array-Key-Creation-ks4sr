```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["a"] = 1;
$myArray["b"] = 2;
$myArray[1] = 3; //integer key

//Corrected way to handle key existence
if (array_key_exists(0, $myArray)) {
  echo "Key 0 exists: " . $myArray[0] . "\n";
} else {
  echo "Key 0 does not exist.\n";
}

//Safe access with isset() and null coalescing
echo "Key 0 value (safe): " . ($myArray[0] ?? 'Key does not exist') . "\n"; //null coalescing operator
?>
```
This corrected code uses `array_key_exists()` to explicitly check for the key's presence before accessing it. Alternatively, the null coalescing operator (`??`) provides a concise and safe way to access the array element, providing a default value if the key is not found.
